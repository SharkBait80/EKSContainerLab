# Module 2: Configure your Amazon EKS Cluster 

**Time to complete:** 15 minutes

**Services used:**
* [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
* [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)


## Overview

In this module, we will use `eksctl` to launch and configure our EKS cluster and worker nodes.

**[Eksctl](https://eksctl.io/)** is a tool jointly developed by AWS and [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/) that automates much of the experience of creating EKS clusters.

Alternative approaches for EKS cluster creation include using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, the AWS Console, or several third-party automation tools.  A complete reference architecture is available [here](https://github.com/thestacks-io/eks-cluster).


## Client Setup

Kubernetes uses the `kubectl` command-line utility for communicating with the EKS Cluster API Server.  Recall that you previously installed `kubectl` in module-1 of this lab. 

1. Using your local Terminal application, login to your remote Linux Dev Environment (configured in module-1).

``` shell
ssh -i MYKEYPAIR.pem ec2-user@myEc2IpAddress
```
```
login examples:
ssh -i ~\downloads\mykeypair.pem ec2-user@ec2-34-219-242-224.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
ssh -i %HOME%\Downloads\mykeypair.pem ec2-user@ec2-34-219-242-224.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

2. Verify that `kubectl` is installed and review the commands available.

``` shell
kubectl
```

3. Amazon EKS uses IAM to provide authentication to your Kubernetes cluster via the [AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html).  Download and install the `aws-iam-authenticator` as follows.

``` shell
sudo curl -L https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.13.7/2019-06-11/bin/linux/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator -o /usr/local/bin/aws-iam-authenticator
```
``` shell
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/aws-iam-authenticator
```

4. Test that the `aws-iam-authenticator` works.

``` shell
aws-iam-authenticator help
```


## Create Cluster

Now you can create your Amazon EKS cluster and a worker node group using the `eksctl` utility.

Many cluster configuration options are available as `eksctl` [documentation](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/blob/master/README.md) illustrates.  However, for our purposes, the default configuration is adequate.

1. Create your cluster as follows.

``` shell
eksctl create cluster
```

2. You may check the progress of your cluster creation using the events tab of the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).

3. The above procedure will take several minutes to complete. In the interim, you may [proceed to Module 3](/module-3) or just wait here. Remember to return to the next step herein. 


## Connect to your Cluster

1. When your cluster is ready, test that your `kubectl` configuration is correct.

``` shell
kubectl get svc
```

2. You should see output similar to the following. If not, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html) for getting started with `eksctl`.

``` 
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
svc/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.100.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   1m
```

** NOTE 7/01 : We may be able to use the Kubernetes Dashboard from our Linux AMI.  It does install.  But, how to view the web-page?  I've also sought to install this on our Windows Server instance.  But, haven't gotten that configuration to work. **

## Optional - Deploy the Kubernetes Web UI Dashboard (10 minutes)

Installing the Kubernetes Web UI Dashboard on your client workstation enables you to view your EKS cluster configuration along with job and performance metrics.  

1. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dashboard-tutorial.html) and see corresponding project files at [Github](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard).



That concludes Module 2.
